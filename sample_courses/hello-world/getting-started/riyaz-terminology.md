# Riyaz Terminology

## Lesson

This is a Riyaz lesson. A lesson has the actual content of a course.
This can be text, images, videos, or embeds from YouTube, OpenLibrary,
etc. Whatever is needed to put together a course.

You can use codeblocks for examples, and use extensions for syntax
highlighting and interactive examples.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

The title of a course is taken from the first heading in the document.
For this lesson, the title would be `Riyaz Terminology`.

## Module

The parent directory of this (`getting-started`) is the module, the
title of the module is expanded from this directory name.
So, `getting-started` becomes `Getting Started`.
